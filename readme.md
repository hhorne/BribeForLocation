# BribeForLocation

Ever wish you could bribe an NPC to just mark a location on your map instead of clicking on it a bunch and hoping they do? Me too, so I made this mod for [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/).

## Development Status

Early devlopment. I have not taken compatibility with existing mods into mind just yet.
